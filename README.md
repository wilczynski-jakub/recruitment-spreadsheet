# Recruitment Management Spreadsheet
A spreadsheet created for effective management of the candidates' data &amp; their stages throughout the recruitment process, with an elegant &amp; colorful look.


## Raw CRM data
When the application process for candidates is managed externally, it might be the case for the gathered data to be delivered to you in a not-very-convenient layout. 
Our data came to us in the following format (a screenshot from the "Raw CRM data" sheet):
<br>
!["Raw CRM data" sheet](screenshots/raw-crm-data.png)
<br>
<i>Note: this is just an example data, therefore all names and phone numbers are randomly generated.</i>

The "JUST COPY THESE" caption suggest to copy the columns A-E (without the header) and paste it in another sheet.


## CANDIDATES
After pasting (as "values only") the above-mentioned cells, from a blank sheet:
<br>
!["CANDIDATES" sheet (1)](screenshots/candidates1.png)
<br>
we're getting this:
<br>
!["CANDIDATES" sheet (2)](screenshots/candidates2.png)
<br>
Thanks to certain formulas (e.g. showing the candidates' age instead of a date of birth, merging all columns with phone numbers, etc.) this format is much more accessible for the recruiters.
<br><br>
Next step is to assign a recruiter to each candidate:
<br>
!["CANDIDATES" sheet (3)](screenshots/candidates3.png)
<br>
The rows are colored by the name of the person responsible, so that it is easy for the recruiters to find their candidates.
<br><br>
Another coloring is made depending on the stage of each candidate:
<br>
!["CANDIDATES" sheet (4)](screenshots/candidates4.png)
<br>
so that it's clear what actions should be taken for which people. The data can also be sorted by "STAGE", which will move the rejected candidates to the end.

## Weekly availability
When gathering a weekly time availability of candidates, e.g. via Google Forms, in such format:
<br>
![Weekly availability - Google Forms](screenshots/weekly-availability1.png)
<br><br>
The output looks like this:
<br>
!["Weekly availability" sheet (1)](screenshots/weekly-availability2.png)
<br>
which makes it extremely hard to find a time slot when most people are available.
<br><br>
The "Weekly availability" sheet converts this data into a much more accessible form:
<br>
!["Weekly availability" sheet (2)](screenshots/weekly-availability3.png)
<br>
<i> Where: green - available, red - unavailable. </i>
